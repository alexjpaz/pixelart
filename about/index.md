## What is this blog about?
This blog is my attempt at learning various techiniques around creating [pixelart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art). I will post a daily scene in the [gallery]({{ "/gallery" | relative_url }}).

## What are your expected outcomes?

I hope to be able to refine my skills and be confident enought to create a game (using Godot) with my own style rather than copying assets from a community store.

## What else are you doing?

You can find more about me, [{{ site.author.name }}]({{ site.author.website }}), and other [projects](https://alexjpaz.com/projects/) I am working on at my website â€“ [alexjpaz.com](https://alexjpaz.com)
